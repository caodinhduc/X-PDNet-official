## X-PDNet: Accurate Joint Plane Instance Segmentation and Monocular Depth Estimation with Cross-Task Distillation and Boundary Correction (BMVC 2023)
This is an implementation for X-PDNet: a multi-task learning framework for joint plane instance segmentation and depth estimation

The official paper can be found at [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08424v2.pdf). Thank the [PlaneRecNet](https://github.com/EryiXie/PlaneRecNet) for a great baseline implementation

We contribute 3000 images with over 30000 instance masks manually annotated for reliable evaluation of the plane instance segmentation task.
